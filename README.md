# PiBuddy Compose
This a Jetpack Compose rebuild of my app PiBuddy -> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dbtechprojects.pibuddy

## App Description
PiBuddy enables you to connect to your Raspberry Pi and display CPU, Memory, Disk usage, and also the output for a custom command of your choice. The app will save successful connections so you will not need to manually enter connection details each time. The app will also save any custom command used with each device.
